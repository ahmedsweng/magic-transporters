Magic Transporters:

    Introduction
    Welcome to Magic Transporters, the future of moving things easily. These super cool
    transporters, powered by virtual magic, are here to make shipping stuff a breeze.

    Overview
    In the world of Magic Transporters, there are special people known as Magic
    Movers. They use nifty gadgets to move important things. Fueled by virtual magic,
    these Movers go on quick missions to carry items around.

        A Magic Mover has:
        • Weight limit (the most they can carry);
        • Energy (their total magic power);
        • Quest state (what they’re currently doing: resting, loading, on a mission, or
        done).

        Each Magic Item they carry has:
        • Name (what it’s called);
        • Weight (how much magic power it needs);

    Functional requirements
        • Don’t give Magic Movers too much to carry for efficiency;
        • Make a simple list showing who completed the most missions.

    Non-functional requirements
        • Make sure the project is easy to build and run;
        • Set up any needed data before starting (like starting a video game);
        • Use express in Node.js or nestjs framework.
        • Use Typescript
